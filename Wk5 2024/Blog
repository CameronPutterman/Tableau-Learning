This was my first dashboard I made on my own
I just finished my first course with UC Davis and this was an extra credit assignment essentially
All it gave me was a "passed with honors" accolade that I don't think means too much
I did it more for the practice
Far from a masterpiece but a decent jumping off point nonetheless
Love that I am coming into the world of Tableau when the map feature exists
Such a cool addition
